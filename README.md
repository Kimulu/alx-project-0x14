# Arepo Project

This `README.md` provides an overview of the **MoviesDatabase API**, a core component of the Arepo project.

## üìò API Overview

The **MoviesDatabase API** provides a comprehensive collection of movie-related data, allowing developers to integrate film information into their applications. Key features include:

- Movie search
- Detailed film information
- Cast and crew data
- Exploration of genres and categories

This API is ideal for applications like movie listings, recommendation engines, or film-focused social platforms.

## üîñ API Version

> Please refer to the MoviesDatabase API documentation for the current version. The version number is typically found in the "Overview" or "Getting Started" section of the official docs.

## üîó Available Endpoints

| Endpoint             | Description                                                                  |

> Add more endpoints as per the official documentation.

## üì• Request and Response Format

Requests follow standard RESTful conventions, primarily using `GET` methods.

**Example Request:**

```
GET https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/api/movies?genre=action&year=2023
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "tt1234567",
      "title": "Movie Title One",
      "year": 2023,
      "genre": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"],
      "rating": 7.5
    },
    {
      "id": "tt7654321",
      "title": "Another Action Film",
      "year": 2023,
      "genre": ["Action"],
      "rating": 6.9
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "totalResults": 250
  }
}
```

## üîê Authentication

Access to the MoviesDatabase API requires an API Key via RapidAPI.

**Required Headers:**

```
X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com
```

**Example Request with Headers:**

```
GET https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/api/movies
X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

| Status Code | Meaning           | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 400         | Bad Request       | Invalid parameters or malformed request.       |
| 401         | Unauthorized      | Missing or invalid API key.                    |
| 403         | Forbidden         | Insufficient permissions or plan restrictions. |
| 404         | Not Found         | Requested resource not found.                  |
| 429         | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded.                           |
| 500         | Server Error      | A problem occurred on the server.              |

**Example Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
    "message": "Authentication failed. Please provide a valid X-RapidAPI-Key."
  }
}
```

## üìä Usage Limits & Best Practices

- **Rate Limits**: Follow the usage limits defined in your RapidAPI plan (e.g., X requests/sec or Y requests/month).
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to minimize redundant requests. Respect `Cache-Control` headers.
- **Pagination**: Always use pagination (`page`, `pageSize`, `limit`, etc.) to handle large datasets.
- **Error Logging**: Log errors for monitoring and debugging.
