This README.md file provides an overview of the MoviesDatabase API, which is a core component of the Arepo project.

API Overview
The MoviesDatabase API provides a comprehensive collection of movie-related data, enabling developers to integrate film information into their applications. It offers capabilities to search for movies, retrieve detailed information about individual films, access cast and crew data, and potentially explore various categories or genres. This API is designed to support applications requiring rich movie content for features like movie listings, recommendation engines, or film-centric social platforms.

API Version
The API version currently in use is [Please refer to the MoviesDatabase API documentation for the exact version number, typically found in the overview or getting started sections.]

Available Endpoints
Here are the main endpoints available in the MoviesDatabase API:

/movies: [Brief description of what this endpoint does, e.g., "Fetches a list of movies based on various criteria like title, year, genre, etc."]

/movies/{movie_id}: [Brief description of what this endpoint does, e.g., "Retrieves detailed information for a specific movie using its unique ID."]

/genres: [Brief description of what this endpoint does, e.g., "Lists all available movie genres."]

/actors/{actor_id}: [Brief description of what this endpoint does, e.g., "Provides details about a specific actor, including their filmography."]

/search: [Brief description of what this endpoint does, e.g., "Performs a generalized search across movie titles, actors, and other fields."]

[Add more endpoints as listed in the documentation with brief descriptions]

Request and Response Format
A typical request to the MoviesDatabase API follows a standard RESTful pattern, primarily using GET methods for data retrieval. Requests often include parameters in the URL query string for filtering or specifying resources.

Example Request (Illustrative - please replace with actual examples from documentation):

GET [https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/api/movies?genre=action&year=2023](https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/api/movies?genre=action&year=2023)

The API typically returns data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Responses generally include a status, the requested data object or array, and sometimes metadata like pagination information.

Example Response (Illustrative - please replace with actual examples from documentation):

{
"status": "success",
"data": [
{
"id": "tt1234567",
"title": "Movie Title One",
"year": 2023,
"genre": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"],
"rating": 7.5
},
{
"id": "tt7654321",
"title": "Another Action Film",
"year": 2023,
"genre": ["Action"],
"rating": 6.9
}
],
"metadata": {
"page": 1,
"pageSize": 10,
"totalResults": 250
}
}

Authentication
Authentication for the MoviesDatabase API primarily uses an API Key. This key must be included in the headers of every request to gain access to the API's resources.

Required Headers:

X-RapidAPI-Key: Your unique API key obtained from RapidAPI.

X-RapidAPI-Host: The host domain for the API (e.g., moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com).

Example (Illustrative):

GET [https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/api/movies](https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/api/movies)
X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com

Error Handling
The MoviesDatabase API communicates errors through standard HTTP status codes and provides a JSON response body with details about the error. Common error responses include:

400 Bad Request: Indicates a problem with the request parameters or body. The response will usually contain a message explaining the invalid input.

401 Unauthorized: Occurs when the API key is missing or invalid.

403 Forbidden: Your API key might be valid, but you lack permissions to access the requested resource, or your subscription plan does not allow the specific request.

404 Not Found: The requested resource (e.g., a movie with a specific ID) does not exist.

429 Too Many Requests: You have exceeded the API's rate limits.

500 Internal Server Error: A problem occurred on the API server's side.

Example Error Response (Illustrative):

{
"error": {
"code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
"message": "Authentication failed. Please provide a valid X-RapidAPI-Key."
}
}

It is crucial to implement proper error handling in your application to gracefully manage these responses and provide informative feedback to the user.

Usage Limits and Best Practices
To ensure fair usage and optimal performance, the MoviesDatabase API has certain limitations and best practices:

Rate Limits: [Specify the rate limits, e.g., "X requests per second/minute" or "Y requests per month" as detailed in the API plan.] Exceeding these limits will result in 429 Too Many Requests errors. Implement exponential backoff or token bucket algorithms in your application to handle rate limiting effectively.

Caching: Cache frequently requested data to reduce the number of API calls and improve application responsiveness. Respect Cache-Control headers if provided by the API.

Pagination: For endpoints returning large datasets, always utilize pagination parameters (e.g., page, pageSize, limit, offset) to fetch data in manageable chunks.

Error Logging: Log API errors to monitor issues and troubleshoot problems with your integration.

Secure API Key Storage: Never hardcode your API key directly into client-side code. Use environment variables or a secure server-side proxy to manage your API key.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure a robust and efficient integration with the MoviesDatabase API.
